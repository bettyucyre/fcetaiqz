Getting banned from Faceit can feel like the ultimate rage quit, especially if you swear on your keyboard it was a total mistake. No worries! This quick & cheeky guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal like a pro to get back into the matchmaking madness.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned lightning-fast after making a shiny new Faceit account? Or does the ban shadow follow you like a grumpy ghost across multiple accounts? Congrats, you might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Faceit has flagged your PC’s hardware signature, making new accounts useless.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your email or Faceit notifications carefully to see why they booted you out. Common ban reasons include:
- Cheating or using unauthorized 3rd party software  
- Griefing, toxicity, or abusing other players  
- Account sharing or suspicious login activity

**Hot tip:** Always revisit the Faceit Terms of Service before firing off your appeal—foundation first!
